# Hybrid Repository Scaffolding System Context Map

> This context map is generated by the Hybrid Scaffolding System for NotebookLM. It provides a curated, high-signal index of the most critical architectural and structural documentation derived from the four consolidated repositories: github/awesome-copilot, github/spec-kit, bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD, and Fission-AI/OpenSpec.

## Core Documentation and Architecture

### Primary Entry Points (High Signal)

*   [System Architecture Overview](./architecture.md): Defines the logical layers, high-level dependencies, and architectural patterns derived from the analysis of all modules.
*   [Domain Blueprint & Context Richness](./blueprint.md): Maps the core domain models and entities, detailing components with the highest Cyclomatic Complexity and Centrality scores.
*   [API Endpoint Specifications](./api-specs.md): Signatures and contracts for all major public interfaces found across the repositories.

## Optional Context (Detailed Implementations)

These files provide lower-priority implementation details and utilities.

*   [Utils and Helpers Summary](./utilities.md): Concise summaries of low-centrality, low-complexity utility functions and helper libraries.
*   [Configuration and Environment Details](./config.md): Summaries of configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) [11].
